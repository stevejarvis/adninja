# Ad Ninja
## Hiya! About.
Ad Ninja is an Android application to block popup advertisements in
applications.

This was a project from early in my CS career, and (at least at the time) does
its job pretty well. I have always felt I had a slight dilemna with this
app, as it effects one of the primary methods which developers generate
income in an already fiscally difficult Android (and open source) community.
Ideally, Ad Ninja would evolve to behave more like browsers' AdBlock Plus and
exhibit selective filtering, rather than universally on or off.

## Contributing
As mentioned, this project is from days of yore and has sat, untouched, in the
Google Play Store for about three years. It could use some refreshing, and help
is very appreciated. Please fork and pull request away!

Ad Ninja is a paid application, but I would much rather see it evolve and update
than continue charging for installs. If this project gains traction here I will
happily either a) change it to a free install or b) share income with
contributors.

[Check it out in the Play Store!]
